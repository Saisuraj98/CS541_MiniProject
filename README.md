# CS541_MiniProject

Our Project is based on Deep Image Resolution learning

Deep convolutional neural networks have made a lot of progress in the field of image classification!
The method used for this project is DeepLab model

This project is flexible to implement on many datasets, but I have choose to implement on COCO dataset. The MS COCO (Microsoft Common Objects in Context) dataset is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, key-point detection, and captioning dataset. The dataset consists of 328K images.!

DeepLab is a state-of-art deep learning model for semantic image segmentation, where the goal is to assign semantic labels (e.g., person, dog, cat and so on) to every pixel in the input image.
