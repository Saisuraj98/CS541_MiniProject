# CS541_MiniProject

Our Project is based on Deep Image Resolution learning

Deep convolutional neural networks have made a lot of progress in the field of image classification!
The method used for this project is DeepLab model

This project is flexible to implement on many datasets, but I have choose to implement on COCO dataset. The MS COCO (Microsoft Common Objects in Context) dataset is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, key-point detection, and captioning dataset. The dataset consists of 328K images.!

DeepLab is a state-of-art deep learning model for semantic image segmentation, where the goal is to assign semantic labels (e.g., person, dog, cat and so on) to every pixel in the input image. 

**
How to Run the code ?**

the code is attached to this repository and you can open the code and run it in collab or jupyter. 
In the last cell of the code there is an option to give input image URl, use any image from internet and paste its URL over there, so you can see the output as which type of object is there in the image
